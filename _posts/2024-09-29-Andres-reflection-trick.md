Here's an interesting problem related to voting and ballot counts:

**Suppose A and B win p and q votes respectively in an election with p > q. While counting the ballots, what is the probability that A always remains ahead of B throughout the count?**

The problem is recast graphically and then Andre's beautiful insight solves the problem quickly. Watch it explained in this video:
