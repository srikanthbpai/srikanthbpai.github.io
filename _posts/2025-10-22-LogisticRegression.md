In today's guest post, a B.A. Econ student at MSE, [Ms.Maahika Mathur](https://sites.google.com/view/maahika-mathur/) explains the logistic regression problem using the classic _Telco Customer Churn_ dataset. I usually cover this problem in the _Probability for GenAI_ course, co-taught with [Dr. Ajay Shenoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bastyajayshenoy/?originalSubdomain=in).  
I have a Python notebook that demonstrates both the mathematics and the implementation behind this method. Maahika studied that notebook and offered to write an expository article expanding on it.
