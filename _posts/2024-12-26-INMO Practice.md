1. Points E and F are given on side BC of a convex quadrilateral ABCD (with E closer than F to B). Suppose angle EAB = angle CDF and angle FAE = angle FDE. Prove that angle CAF = angle EDB. (Hint: Show ABCD is concyclic!)
2. Two intersecting circles C1 and C2 have a common tangent which touches C1 at P and C2 at Q. The two circles intersect at M and N, where N is nearer to PQ than M is. The line PN meets the circle C2 again at R. Prove that MQ bisects angle PMR. (Hint: Join common chord. Angle chase. Use alternate segment theorem.)
3. In an acute-angled triangle ABC, AM is the median on BC, AL is the internal angle bisector of ∠BAC and AH is the altitude (H lies between L and B). It is known that ML = LH = HB. Find the ratios of the sidelengths of ABC. (Hint: Direct by angle bisector theorem and spotting an isosceles triangle. You may use Stewart's theorem.)
4. The point I is the incentre of triangle ABC. Points X,Y are located on the line segments AB and, AC respectively so that $BX.AB=IB^2$ and $CY.AC=IC^2$ . Given that X, I, Y and are collinear, find the possible values of the measure of angle A. (Hint: Use converse to the power of a point to show IX, IY are tangents. Now use $\angle BIC  = 90 + A/2$.)
5. Two intersecting circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ have a common tangent intersecting $C_1$ in P and $C_2$ in Q . These two circles intersect in M and N where N is nearer to PQ than M . Prove that the triangles MNP and MNQ have equal areas. (Hint: Common chord bisects the common tangent. And triangles with equal bases on a common segment, with a fixed vertex not on the segment, are equal in area.)
6. A class of problems:
   1. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with diagonal point E. Let F, G, H, and I be the centroids of triangles △ABE, △BCE, △CDE, and △DAE, respectively. Then FGHI is a parallelogram. (Hint: Dilate about E by a factor of 3 and use Varignon's theorem.)
   2. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with diagonal point E. Let F, G, H, and I be the orthocentres of triangles △ABE, △BCE, △CDE, and △DAE, respectively. Then FGHI is a parallelogram. (Hint: Sides of FGHI are perpendicular to the diagonals since they are segments of the altitudes of triangles with diagonals as bases.)
   3. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with diagonal point E. Let F, G, H, and I be the circumcentres of triangles △ABE, △BCE, △CDE, and △DAE, respectively. Then FGHI is a parallelogram.(Hint: Sides of FGHI are perpendicular to the diagonals since they are segments of the altitudes of triangles with diagonals as bases.)
7. Let O, I be circumcentre and incentre of a triangle and let R, r be circumradius and inradius. Show O I 2 = R 2 -2Rr.
8. Points K, L, M and N lying on the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA of a square ABCD are vertices of another square. Lines DK and NM meet at point E, and lines KC and LM meet at point F. Prove that EF is parallel to AB.

11. Let I be the incentre and I A be the A -excentre of a triangle ABC . Prove that the circumcircle of triangle ABC passes through the midpoint of the line segment I I A .
12. Let ABCD be a trapezoid with BC parallel to AD and AB = CD. A circle ω centred at I is tangent to the segments AB, CD, and DA. The circle BIC meets the side AB at points B and E. Prove that CE is tangent to ω.

    AB meet CD at P. Let tangent from E meet CD at C'. Incentre-Excentre lemma in triangle PEC' says angle EIC' = 90 - p/2 where p = angle EPC'. BC || AD means angle EBC = 90+p/2 and since E,B,C,I are concyclic, angle EIC = 90 - p/2. Thus angle EIC = angle EIC' and thus C=C'.

13. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB=AC. Suppose that the angle bisector of ∠ B meets AC at D and that BC=BD+AD . Determine ∠ A .
14. Let A, B, P be three points on a circle. Prove that if a and b are the distances from P to the tangents at A and B and c is the distance from P to the chord AB, then c 2 =ab .

    L is the centre of (BMN) since O is the orthocentre of triangle BMN. So OB is parallel to LK and OK=LB since the radii of reflected circle.

22. Let BC be a chord of a circle Γ. Let ω be a circle tangent to chord BC at K and internally tangent to ω at T. Then ray TK passes through the midpoint M of the arc BC not containing T.
