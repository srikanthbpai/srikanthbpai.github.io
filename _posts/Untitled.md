1. (BMO 2000) Two intersecting circles C1 and C2 have a common tangent which touches C1 at P and C2 at Q. The two circles intersect at M and N, where N is nearer to PQ than M is. The line PN meets the circle C2 again at R. Prove that MQ bisects angle PMR.
2. (BMO 2001) Circle S lies inside circle T and touches it at A. From a point P (distinct from A) on T, chords PQ and PR of T are drawn touching S at X and Y respectively. Show that ∠ QAR=2 ∠ XAY.
3. (BMO R1 2020) Let points 𝐴, 𝐵 and 𝐶 lie on a circle Γ. Circle Δ is tangent to 𝐴𝐶 at 𝐴. It meets Γ again at 𝐷 and the line 𝐴𝐵 again at 𝑃. The point 𝐴 lies between points 𝐵 and 𝑃. Prove that if 𝐴𝐷 = 𝐷𝑃, then 𝐵𝑃 = 𝐴𝐶.

 4. 1. (BMO R1 2015) Let ABCD be a cyclic quadrilateral and let the lines CD and BA meet at E. The line through D which is tangent to the circle ADE meets the line CB at F. Prove that the triangle CDF is isosceles.
 5. (BMO R1 2012) Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle. The feet of the altitudes from A,B and C are D, E and F respectively. Prove that DE+DF ≤ BC and determine the triangles for which equality holds.
 6. (RMO 2016) Let ABC be a triangle with centroid G. Let the circumcircle of triangle AGB intersect the line BC in X different from B; and the circumcircle of triangle AGC intersect the line BC in Y different from C. Prove that G is the centroid of triangle AXY.
