# Hello,

_If you are here to join my Target RMO 25 course from elsewhere, the join button is at the bottom of the page. Otherwise read on._

My name is Srikanth Pai. I am passionate about mathematics and teaching. I have two Master's degrees and two PhD degrees, one from IISc Bangalore and another from ICTS-TIFR Bangalore. I am trained in engineering, physics, and mathematics. I have been an Olympiad coach for the past 12 years, and some of my students have represented the country in IMO. Fortunately, I have worked with coaching classes that have granted me some time for Olympiad training. However, the education industry of this country focuses too much on JEE-type mathematics. A diverse country like India requires diverse approaches to appreciating mathematics. I have accumulated distinct techniques and a unique approach to teaching mathematics. In the past few years:

- I have created videos on my YouTube channel [Aha!Problems](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCte6PsCjmIJXqVOgSEmO_vg) to spread the joy of mathematics.
- I have blog posts outlining [problem-solving techniques](https://srikanthbpai.github.io/blog/2024/Perfect-square-Olympiad/).
- I have taught an undergraduate course (group theory) to motivated high school students.
- I have also published solutions to proposed problems in renowned magazines like [Crux Mathematicorum](https://cms.math.ca/publications/crux/) and helped my students publish their solutions.
- In the future, I plan to create workbooks for high school students to enjoy more profound ideas in mathematics.

I did all of this because I wanted to experience the joy of watching others enjoy mathematics because of my hard work. Hence, I named the collective effort _Mudhitha_.<u> Different students wish to experience mathematics in its distinct forms instead of the usual JEE coaching bundle alone.</u> Problem-solving, theory-building, hands-on modelling, and interdisciplinary applications are some particular forms of mathematical experiences.

In a well-thought-out course, mathematical ideas fit neatly like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. I strive to do that for my students, and I have had the fortune to think about this for two decades. For those 8th/9th grade students who want to focus on intense mathematical problem-solving, Mudhitha presents _Target RMO_.

# What is Target RMO 2025?

Olympiad exams test mathematical prowess akin to how the Olympics test physical prowess. The exam is meant to identify mathematically gifted students. The first exam stage is IOQM, and qualified students write the RMO exam (see [this for IOQM 2024](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/about-olympiads/stages/mathematical-olympiad/)). Whether a student succeeds in cracking the exam or not, the road to preparation has incredible long-term personal benefits for the student:

- Improves critical thinking and mathematical reasoning skills,
- Learn rigorous approaches to problem-solving and writing,
- Imbibe a focused regimen to prepare for a competitive exam.

Target RMO 2025 is a program that trains mathematically minded students in the standard Olympiad curriculum and guides them on their journey to RMO 2025. Families keen on cracking the exam or catalysing their child's growth have the additional option of a personalised attention package.

The first iteration of this course was RMO 2024, and I am pleased about the outcomes. I will be teaching an advanced batch for RMO 2024 participants, focusing on INMO-level techniques (see [INMO 2025]({{ site.url }}/downloads/INMO_2025.pdf) paper).

# Learnings from Target RMO 2024

Last year, 10 Target RMO students joined with mostly zero scores in IOQM 2023. Within seven months of rigorous training, Pradyun **qualified** by scoring a remarkable 38 marks in IOQM 2024! Naman and Nabhanyu scored 21 and 27 outstanding marks, respectively! I am also happy that the absentee rate was meagre, even though classes were at 5:30 AM, and feedback shows that most students enjoyed the classes.

_I am very proud that Pradyun qualified under the Karnataka category and Naman under the OCI category._

The quality of high scorers were:

- They enjoy mathematical problem-solving and have a hunger to learn,
- They responded positively to my mentoring efforts by clarifying their misunderstandings,
- They were disciplined and regularly submitted homework honestly (with minimal use of AI/online sources),
- They worked on my feedback/hints and discussed alternate approaches,
- They also had incredible parental support.

Personalised attention to homework, counselling students with their families, and supporting students who want to do extracurricular math were very effective for some families but very time-consuming for me. So, to use everyone's time and money efficiently, I have proposed two options for Target RMO 2025.

# Details of Target RMO 2025

Target RMO 2025 has two options:

In _Teaching_, you learn from a specially crafted theory path and a customised homework scheme. You can access regular tests, and I will give hints after the test if I see some effort. We will discuss solutions to some problems in class. You get access to the recorded video to revise and catch up.

_Mentorship_ is a unique offering where you get personalised attention in terms of feedback for homework, strategies and guidance for publishing solutions in renowned math magazines. The following table gives a quick snapshot, and additional details can be found below the table:

| Feature                                        | Teaching | Mentorship |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Over 100 lecture hours with discussions        | ✓        | ✓          |
| Recorded classes (for three months)            | ✓        | ✓          |
| Homework per class                             | ✓        | ✓          |
| Weekly mastery sets                            | ✓        | ✓          |
| Over 6 Regular Tests and 8 Mock IOQM/RMO tests | ✓        | ✓          |
| Regular personalised feedback                  | ✗        | ✓          |
| Counselling with parents                       | ✗        | ✓          |
| Enabling Magazine publications                 | ✗        | ✓          |
| Personalised strategies for Olympiad prep      | ✗        | ✓          |
| **Limited seats** **(up to 5)**                | ✗        | ✓          |

**Class Timings:** Weekly 4 hours from February mid to August end. Early mornings on weekends (5 AM to 7 AM). Early mornings have proven to be a game changer in learning for me. I usually wake up at that time on weekdays to do my research.

**Homework and Weekly practice:** After class, simple applications of taught concepts are given as homework. If the student diligently finishes their homework, it cements the ideas learnt that day. Weekly mastery sets, which include a mix of easy warmups and classic Olympiad problems, are given at the end of the week. The student should attempt as many as possible and submit the solutions within a week, but they should periodically retry the sets.

**Tests:** Last year, my students' IOQM mark order precisely reflected the mock test average mark order (after correcting for cheating using internet/AI tools). So, the tests are excellent predictors of IOQM performance. These tests follow an honour code: Students will not use internet materials or AI. I am not going to monitor the students. Some attempts are made to make searching hard, but I cannot stop AI from giving ideas. However, I will keep a few Vivas for Mentorship students, where cheating is hard.

**Exclusive Mentorship benefits:** I plan to dedicate time to helping students under mentorship. My hints and feedback on daily and weekly homework are the most valuable benefits for the families. Students who work on the input can achieve wonders.

Olympiads are difficult exams, and it is impossible to answer all the questions correctly. Therefore, students must use their discretion when choosing problems. I will identify the candidates' strengths and weaknesses and help them focus on their strengths.

Reading mathematics magazines keeps students abreast of the latest techniques. I encourage students to submit their solutions to the monthly columns of renowned math magazines like Crux Mathematicorum, Mathematical Reflections, etc.

# Joining RMO 2025

- The classes will be online through MS Teams, and there will be a trial period of 2 classes.
- The fee for **Teaching is Rs.25,000/- and Mentorship is Rs.45,000/-.**
- Families that do not want to continue the classes are free to do so after discussing their situation with me. I will issue a pro-rata refund.
- I am very serious about my students' mental health. Math Olympiad problem-solving is **fun**. If a student cannot enjoy it for prolonged periods, I will ask the family to stop my classes. I will then issue a pro-rata refund.
- The pro-rata refund for the Teaching option is computed according to the number of classes given and tests taken. The additional weekly effort and strategy are factored into the computation for Mentorship.
- Usually, classes are not cancelled during final exams since different schools have exams at various times.
