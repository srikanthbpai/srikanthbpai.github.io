# What is Target RMO 2025?

Olympiad exams test mathematical prowess akin to how the Olympics test physical prowess. The exam is meant to identify mathematically gifted students. The first exam stage is IOQM, and qualified students write the RMO exam (see [this for IOQM 2024](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/about-olympiads/stages/mathematical-olympiad/)). Whether a student succeeds in cracking the exam or not, the road to preparation has incredible long-term personal benefits for the student:

- Improves critical thinking and mathematical reasoning skills,
- Learn rigorous approaches to problem-solving and writing,
- Imbibe a focused regimen to prepare for a competitive exam.

Target RMO 2025 is a program that trains mathematically minded students in the standard Olympiad curriculum and guides them on their journey to RMO 2025. Families keen on cracking the exam or catalysing their child's growth have the additional option of a personalised attention package.

# Learnings from Target RMO 2024

Last year, 10 Target RMO students joined with mostly zero scores in IOQM 2023, and within 7 months of rigorous training, Pradyun **qualified** by scoring a remarkable 38 marks in IOQM 2024! Naman and Nabhanyu scored outstanding 21 and 27 marks, respectively! I am also happy that the absentee rate was meagre, even though classes were at 5:30 AM, and feedback shows that most students enjoyed the classes.

_I am very proud that Pradyun qualified under the Karnataka category and Naman under the OCI category._

The quality of high scorers were:

- They enjoy mathematical problem-solving and have a hunger to learn,
- They responded positively to my mentoring efforts by clarifying their misunderstandings,
- They were disciplined and regularly submitted homework honestly (with minimal use of AI/online sources),
- They worked on my feedback/hints and discussed alternate approaches,
- They also had incredible parental support.

Personalised attention to homework, counselling students with their families, and supporting students who want to do extracurricular math were very effective for some families but very time-consuming for me. So, to use everyone's time and money efficiently, I have proposed two options for Target RMO 2025.

# Details of Target RMO 2025

Target RMO 2025 has two options:

In _Coaching_, you use a specially crafted theory path and a customised homework scheme for the class.

_Mentorship_ is a unique offering where you get personalised attention in terms of feedback for homework, strategies and guidance for publishing solutions in renowned math magazines. The following table gives a quick snapshot, and additional details can be found below the table:

| Feature                                        | Coaching | Mentorship |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Over 100 lecture hours with discussions        | ✓        | ✓          |
| Recorded classes (for three months)            | ✓        | ✓          |
| Homework per class                             | ✓        | ✓          |
| Weekly mastery sets                            | ✓        | ✓          |
| Over 6 Regular Tests and 8 Mock IOQM/RMO tests | ✓        | ✓          |
| Regular personalised feedback                  | ✗        | ✓          |

| Personalised strategies for Olympiad prep      | ✗        | ✓          |
| **Limited seats** **(up to 3)**                | ✗        | ✓          |

**Class Timings:** Weekly 4 hours from January mid to August end. Early mornings on weekends (5 AM to 7 AM). Early mornings have proven to be a game changer in learning for me. I usually wake up at that time on weekdays to do my research.

**Homework and Weekly practice:** After class, simple applications of taught concepts are given as homework. If the student diligently finishes their homework, it cements the ideas learnt that day. Weekly mastery sets, which include a mix of easy warmups and classic Olympiad problems, are given at the end of the week. The student should attempt as many as possible and submit the solutions within a week, but they should periodically retry the sets.

**Tests:** Last year, my students' IOQM mark order precisely reflected the mock test average mark order (after correcting for cheating using internet/AI tools). So, the tests are excellent predictors of IOQM performance. These tests follow an honour code: Students will not use internet materials or AI. I am not going to monitor the students. Some attempts are made to make searching hard, but I cannot stop AI from giving ideas. However, I will keep a few Vivas for Mentorship students, where cheating is hard.

**Exclusive Mentorship benefits:** I plan to dedicate time to helping students under mentorship. My hints and feedback on daily and weekly homework are the most valuable benefits for the families. Students who work on the input can achieve wonders.

Olympiads are difficult exams, and it is impossible to answer all the questions correctly. Therefore, students must use their discretion when choosing problems. I will identify the candidates' strengths and weaknesses and help them focus on their strengths.

Reading mathematics magazines keeps students abreast of the latest techniques. I encourage students to submit their solutions to the monthly columns of renowned math magazines like Crux Mathematicorum, Mathematical Reflections, etc.

# Joining RMO 2025

- There will be a trial period of 2 classes.
- The fee for Coaching is Rs.25,000/- and Mentorship is Rs.45,000/-.
- Families that do not want to continue the classes are free to do so after discussing their situation with me. I will issue a pro-rata refund.
- I am very serious about my students' mental health. I consider Math Olympiad problem-solving **fun**. If a student cannot enjoy it for prolonged periods, I will ask the family to stop my classes. I will then issue a pro-rata refund (details are given below).
