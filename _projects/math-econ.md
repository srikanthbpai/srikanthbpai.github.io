This project explores the role of singularities and asymptotics in differential equations used in economic growth models. Inspired by special function theory, we examine how sudden time variation in savings or depreciation alters solution behavior.

## Subprojects

- **Singularities in Growth Equations**  
  _Exploring how power-law variations in coefficients affect stability near steady states._

- **Confluent Hypergeometric Equations in Economics**  
  _Using classical second-order equations to analyze post-shock dynamics in models like Solow._

- **Tauberian Theorems and Economic Dynamics**  
  _Studying how Laplace-domain behavior governs the short-run responses in capital accumulation._
