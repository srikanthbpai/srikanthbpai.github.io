<p class="lead">
I explore how modern mathematical and computational ideas reshape classical finance.  
My current work focuses on three connected directions:

<div class="highlight-box">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Beyond Normality:</strong> Asset returns often display heavy tails and volatility clustering.  
  I study alternatives to the Gaussian paradigm, such as LÃ©vyâ€“Stable and Tempered Stable processes, and their implications for inference and pricing.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependence and Systemic Risk:</strong> Linear correlation underestimates joint extremes.  
  I use copulas and tail-dependence models to quantify multi-asset crash risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning and Control in Finance:</strong> Reinforcement-learning frameworks can reinterpret classical problems in portfolio choice and market making.</li>

## 1. Rethinking Distributional Assumptions

Mandelbrot and Fama questioned the lognormal model of asset prices.  
Empirical evidence suggests that returns may follow heavy-tailed processes with infinite variance.  
Our projects revisit this premise using both model-selection and pricing approaches.

### ðŸ”¹ Rolling AIC for Stable vs Normal
_Tracking how market regimes switch between normal and stable distributions using rolling model-comparison techniques._  
**Collaborator:** Hariharasudhan (B.A. Economics, MSE)

### ðŸ”¹ Event Study Analysis under Stable Tails
_Analyzing stock price reactions around corporate and political events to evaluate market efficiency when returns exhibit stable tails, volatility clustering, and dependence._  
**Collaborator:** Tania (B.A. Economics, MSE)

### ðŸ”¹ A Generalized Tempered Stable Approach to Option Pricing
_Extending the LÃ©vyâ€“Stable framework by tempering its tails to create a tractable yet heavy-tailed model suitable for option pricing.  
Compares traditional Blackâ€“Scholes pricing with a Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) formulation using Fourier methods._  
**Collaborators:** Mr. Sushant Singh and Mr. Jai Shivam (PGDM, MSE)

## 2. Modeling Dependence and Tail Risk

Classical correlation is inadequate for joint extremes.  
This stream focuses on copulas and multivariate dependence structures to capture systemic vulnerability in Indian markets.

### ðŸ”¹ Copulas and Tail Risk
_Measuring joint downside crashes across Nifty stocks using lower-tail-dependence copulas._  
**Collaborators:** Ms. Amritha (M.A. Economics, MSE) and Dr. Ekta Selarka (MSE)

## 3. Portfolio Optimisation with Modern Reinforcement Learning

Classical portfolio theory assumes static rebalancing under fixed riskâ€“return trade-offs.  
In contrast, reinforcement learning treats portfolio management as a sequential decision process under uncertainty.  
Our work explores how **policy-gradient** methods can dynamically learn allocation strategies that adapt to changing market conditions and transaction costs.

**Collaborators:** Ongoing work with Dr. Arun Selvan.
