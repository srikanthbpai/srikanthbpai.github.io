I am an Assistant Professor at <a href='https://www.mse.ac.in'> Madras School of Economics</a>. I mainly teach statistics and probability related subjects to undergraduates. Look at the <a href='https://srikanthbpai.github.io/teaching/'> teaching page </a> for more details.

In my free time, I like to think about higher categorical problems like constructing extended TQFTs, and representations of higher groups. The projects page contains details about my research work.

By training I am an electrical communication engineer (ME and PhD from <a href='https://iisc.ac.in'>I.I.Sc</a>, Bangalore and B.Tech from <a href='https://www.nitk.ac.in'>NITK Surathkal</a>), a theoretical physicist and a mathematician (M.Sc and PhD from <a href='https://www.icts.res.in'>ICTS Bangalore</a>).

Outside my working hours, I share my passion for mathematical problem solving on my <a href='https://youtube.com/@mudithamath?feature=shared'>YouTube channel</a>.

Recently, I have been automating many parts of teaching routines using AI and "vibe-coding". Although it requires copius amounts of patience, it has been intellectually rewarding and has gotten me curious about LLMs. A nice website that is publicly available is a [flashcard website](https://time-series-flashcards.onrender.com) for the first 5 chapters of Hamilton's time series analysis. Just note than you may to wait for a few minutes for the website to load.

I am a homebody. I love collecting stationaries (especially fountain pens and inks), watching animes and rom-coms. I have a decent collection of books and a diverse video game collection.
