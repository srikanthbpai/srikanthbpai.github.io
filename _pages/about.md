I am an Assistant Professor at <a href='https://www.mse.ac.in'> Madras School of Economics</a>. I mainly teach statistics and probability related subjects to undergraduates. Look at the Teaching page for more details.

In my free time, I like to think about higher categorical problems like constructing extended TQFTs, and representations of higher groups. I explain in detail on my Research page.

By training I am an electrical communication engineer(ME and PhD from <a href='https://iisc.ac.in'>I.I.Sc</a>, and B.Tech from <a href='https://www.nitk.ac.in'>NITK Surathkal</a>), a theoretical physicist and a mathematician (M.Sc and PhD from <a href='https://www.icts.res.in'>ICTS Bangalore</a>).

Outside my working hours, I share my passion for mathematical problem solving on my <a href='https://youtube.com/@mudithamath?feature=shared'>YouTube channel</a>.

I am a homebody. I love collecting stationaries (especially fountain pens and inks), watching animes and rom-coms. I have a decent collection of books and a diverse video game collection. You can look at Miscellany for more details.
