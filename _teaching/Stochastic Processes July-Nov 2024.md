*Prerequisites: Probability theory, Matrix Algebra, Differential equations.* An advanced course covering Markov processes, Poisson Process, Wiener Process, Martingales, and applications to finance and economics was given to BA third-year students. The first half was spent studying Discrete-time Markov Chain theory. In the second half, I plan to cover the Poisson and Weiner Process, Continuous-time Markov Chains, Martingales and the basics of Brownian motion.
