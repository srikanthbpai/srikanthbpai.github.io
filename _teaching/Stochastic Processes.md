## Syllabus

Definition and examples of Stochastic processes. General properties of Stochastic process like independent increment and stationary increment properties. 

Introduction to Discrete time Markov chains: Definition, examples. Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. Absorbing state theory. State structure of finite state markov chains, theorems on transience and positive recurrence, ergodic and stationary properties. 

Poisson processes and theorems related to waiting times under various conditions. Thinning and superposition properties of Poisson processes. 

Continuous time markov chains: Chapman-Kolmogorov. Rate transition matrix along with Kolmogorov backward/forward differential equations. ODE approach to CTMC and matrix exponentials. Idea of pure jump regular CTMC data decomposed into sojourn times and an embedded DTMC. Poisson process as a CTMC. Birth-Death processes. 

Wigner process and intro to Brownian motion.
## Course Objectives

The basic objective of the course is to expose undergraduates to random processes and probability theory techniques used to analyse such processes. Since most phenomenon in economics and finance are studied over time, the course is designed to enable the students identify crucial properties of a stochastic process and compute relevant quantities.
