## Logistics 

Timings: Tuesdays and Fridays at 11:30 AM, Tutorials on Wednesday 2:00 PM.

TA for the course: Nikhil Rajan and Hariharasudhan Selvaraj.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are *Statistics for Economics, Econometrics, Linear Algebra.*

Our undergraduates have already studied a Macroeconomics course that heavily drew elements from Ender's Applied Econometric Time Series. They have also studied a rigorous [Stochastic Processes course]({{ site.url }}/_teaching/Stochastic Processes 25.md). 

## Course Objectives

This course develops the mathematical foundations underlying the Box–Jenkins methodology. The primary objective is to train students to reason rigorously about time series models—how they are constructed, when they are valid, and why they work. Rather than treating models as recipes, the course aims to equip students with the conceptual tools needed to build, modify, and critically assess models on their own.

A secondary objective is to expose students to the process by which mathematical methods are developed: starting from concrete problems, introducing abstraction only when necessary, and understanding the trade-offs involved in modeling choices. 

Classroom discussions focus on conceptual, mathematical and programming exploration. Examinations and assignments test precision, rigor, and depth of understanding.

## Course Resources

To support the course, I have developed a custom flashcard-based resource:

The site may take 3–5 minutes to load after long periods of inactivity. Last years webpage can also be accessed on this site.
