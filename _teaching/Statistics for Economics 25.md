## Course Objectives

This course provides a rigorous foundation for reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty — a central challenge in economics and data analysis. It introduces the mathematical structure of probability theory, emphasizing the formulation of random phenomena through sample spaces, events, and the axioms of probability. Students will learn to describe and analyze random variables, compute and interpret expectations, variances, and covariances, and use moment-generating functions to characterize distributions and sums of random variables.

The course further develops familiarity with standard probability models such as the Binomial, Poisson, Normal, and Gamma distributions, including their interrelationships and multivariate extensions. Students will study asymptotic results such as the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which provide approximations for complex random behavior.

Building on these probabilistic foundations, the course introduces statistical inference, including point estimation, properties of estimators such as bias and efficiency, and methods such as maximum likelihood and the method of moments. Finally, students will learn the principles of hypothesis testing, developing a systematic framework for comparing competing models and drawing reliable conclusions from data.

## Results

My course was modelled on the [MIT course on statistics for economists.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-30-introduction-to-statistical-method-in-economics-spring-2006/pages/readings/) Some students found it challenging, but I have balanced this issue by correcting the exams leniently. 

Anyway, I am satisfied with the class performance. I am happy to announce that seven students scored O grades (highest grade). All these students are very good at probability and statistics. 

 Due to the institution's constraints, my lenient correction has some unintended consequences. Some students below a B+ grade may know very little probability and statistics. For institutions gauging a student's marks and relative performance, please ask me for a reference letter, and I can tell you precisely where my students stand.
