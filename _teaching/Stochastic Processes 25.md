Introduction to probability space and partition sigma algebras (discrete random variables). Conditional expectation with respect to sigma algebras. 

Martingales and the basic theorems motivated by gambling. Relations between DTMC and martingales via potential theory. 

Finance: Expected utility, risk profiles of agents and derivations of fundamental pricing equations in finance (Cochrane and Lucas views). Martingale Asset pricing theorem with proof.

## Course Notes

Since there are very few books that integrate macroeconomics and finance applications into a stochastic process course, I have typed up some notes. I am working on these notes and they are far from complete. So use it at your own peril: [Srikanth Pai's Course Notes (in progress)](/assets/pdf/StocProcDraft.pdf)

## Course Objectives
The course introduces undergraduates to probability theory and random processes, with an emphasis on methods used to analyze dynamic phenomena in economics and finance. The objective is twofold: (i) to equip students with the mathematical tools to identify and characterize the essential properties of stochastic processes, and (ii) to train them to compute and interpret quantities of interest such as expectations, distributions, and limiting behaviors. Alongside the theory, students will read and analyze classic papers in economics and finance where stochastic methods play a central role, in order to see how abstract tools are applied in frontier research.
