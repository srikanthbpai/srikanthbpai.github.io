## Course Objectives
the subjectâ€™s objective has been to provide the theoretical foundation for all of the var- ious procedures that are used for describing and analyzing data. What it has not spoken to at much length are the important questions of which procedure to use in a given situation, and why. But those are precisely the concerns that every user of statistics must inevitably confront. To that end, adding features that can create a path from the theory of statistics to its practice has become an increasingly high priority.
