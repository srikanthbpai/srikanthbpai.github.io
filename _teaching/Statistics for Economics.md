## Logisitics 
Timings: Thursday at 9:00 AM and Friday at 2:00 PM
Venue: COE Building
Teaching Assistants: Sumana A (BA 2022), Vrisha K(BA 2022)
## Syllabus
Basics of probability theory, random variables and their distributions, special distributions, law of large numbers and central limit theorems, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression.

## Course Objectives
The course will describe the basic techniques used to analyse and describe data. A student of this course will know standard procedures to estimate quantities of interest, compare among competing hypotheses and infer relations between different pieces of data. 

The first half of the course focuses on probability theory which lays the theoretical foundation for the procedures studied in Statistics. In the second half, the procedures of statistics are discussed with rigorous justification.
