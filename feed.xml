I am documenting the solutions and my feelings of difficulty for each problem. I hope you enjoy the solutions. Let me know if you liked it, and share the solutions with interested people.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241103231432.png" alt="Problem 1"/></p> <p><em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> <b>1</b>.</p> <p>Straightforward problem. The invariant of part a is standard. The second part is not too convoluted and is something most people will try. It’s a good beginner problem that sets the mood and eases the participant.</p> <p><em>Proof:</em></p> <p>(a) Suppose n is odd and $a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n$ is a nice rearrangement. Since $a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n$ is a permutation of $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ it is immediate that \[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\ldots + a_n = 1+2+3+\ldots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}2.\] Since $n$ is odd, we note that $n(n+1)/2$ is a multiple of $n$ since $n+1$ is even. This contradicts the niceness of the rearrangement since $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\ldots + a_n$ is a multiple of $n$.</p> <p>(b) If n is even, we claim <em>the rearrangement $2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7,….n,n-1$ is always nice</em>.</p> <p>The proof is by induction on $n$. For $n=2$, clearly $2,1$ is nice since 2 does not divide 3. Suppose we have proved the claim for some even n, then we show the claim holds for n+2. For n+2, we already know $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\ldots + a_k$ is not a multiple of k for $k \leq n$ by induction. Next we note that $a_1+\ldots+a_{n+1} = n(n+1)/2 + (n+1)+1$ which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by $n+1$ since the first two terms are multiples of $n+1$. And finally \[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\ldots + a_{n+2} = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}.\] The number $\frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}$ is not divisible by $n+2$ since the quotient $\frac{(n+3)}{2}$ is a fraction (because n+3 is odd). Thus $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\ldots + a_{n+2}$ is not a multiple of $n+2$. Thus the claim is proved for $n+2$. So the proof of the statement “the rearrangement $2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7,….n,n-1$ is always nice” is complete.</p> <hr/> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241103233834.png" alt="Problem 2"/> <em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> <b>2</b>.</p> <p>Straightforward to guess the answer by trial and error. But proving it requires you to note that $R(n) &gt; n$ eventually. Now $R(n)$ grows as $n^2$ so there will be many ways to do this proof. The proof writing is the main focus of this question since the idea is pretty simple. It’s rated 2 because of the algebra can get messy for a beginner.</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> The key idea is to note that by division algorithm if $a,b$ are natural numbers, then \[a = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor b+ r\] where r is the remainder when a is divided by b. So we have a formula for $R(n)$: \[ R(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(n - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor k\right)\] We note that for $n \geq k &gt; n/2$, we have $1 \leq \frac{n}{k} &lt; 2$. Thus $\lfloor n/k\rfloor = 1$ for this range. The terms in this range are summable and we thus obtain a bound for all $n$: \[R(n) \geq \sum_{k &gt; \lceil n/2\rceil}^n (n-k) = 1+ 2 +\ldots + \left(\lceil n/2 \rceil -1\right) \geq \dfrac{n/2(n/2-1)}{2} = \dfrac{n(n-2)}{8}.\] In the problem, we want to solve for $R(n) = n-1$. Suppose $m$ solves the equation, then \[m-1 = R(m) \geq \dfrac{m(m-2)}{8}.\] Thus we solve the quadratic inequality to get \[8m-8 \geq m^2-2m \implies m^2 -10m + 8 \leq 0 \implies m \leq 9.\] Thus we have to check the first 9 numbers only. We see \[R(1)=0, R(2)=0, R(3)=1, R(4)=1, R(5)=4,R(6)=3,R(7)=8, R(8)=8, R(9)=12,\] thus $1,5$ are the only solutions.</p> <hr/> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104001206.png" alt="Problem 3"/></p> <p><em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> <b>3</b>.</p> <p>I wonder if there is a synthetic solution. All the lengths in the problem make it clear that most solutions will mostly be length bash based. Since there is a busy right angled point (D), it is suitable for a coordinate bash. Sophisticated coordinates computation is not a part of school syllabus and further one should either know various facts or compute heavily to get the relation between coordinates and figure out $a^2=24$.</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> The proof is a straightforward coordinate computation. <em>We have labelled the circumcentre as S instead of O</em>. Look at the diagram below where S, G, I, H are the circumcentre, centroid, incentre and orthocentre of triangle $ABC$, respectively. <img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104001528.png" alt="Figure for problem 3" width="350" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"/></p> <p>Note that $G=\left(0,\dfrac{a}3\right).$ It is well known that G trisects the segment SH (often proved as a part of the Euler line theorem), we have \[2(0,s)+(0,h) = 3(0,a/3)\] and thus $2s+h=a$. It is given in the problem that $2|DS| = 23|HD|$ and thus $2s=23h$. So we have \[h = \frac{a}{24}, \,\, 2s = \frac{23a}{24}.\] Since $S$ is the circumcentre, we must have $|SA|=|SB|$ and thus \[(s-a)^2 = s^2+1.\] Rearranging we get \[a^2-2as = 1 \implies a^2 - (23a^2/24) = 1 \implies a^2 = 24.\] Now this means we compute sidelengths \[|AB|=|AC| = \sqrt{a^2+1}= 5, \,\, |BC|=2.\] Using the angle bisector lemma, we can say that I divides $AD$ in the ratio $|AB|:|BD|=5:1$ and thus \[\dfrac{|AI|}{|ID|} = 5 \implies I = \dfrac{5(0,0)+1(0,a)}{6}=\left(0,\dfrac{a}6\right).\]Since $ID \perp BC$, $D$ is a touch point of the incircle with line $BC$.So $D$ lies on the incircle and the line $ID$ is a diameter. Since $G$ lies on the line $ID$, in order to show $G$ is on the incircle, it suffices to show $GD$ is a diameter. So we show that $I$ is the midpoint of $GD$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $GD$, \[M = (G+D)/2 = (\left(0,\frac{a}3\right)+(0,0))/2 = \left(0,\frac{a}6\right) = I.\] So $G$ lies on the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.</p> <hr/> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104064438.png" alt="Problem 4"/></p> <p><em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> <b>5</b>.</p> <p>I think this is the hardest problem in the set. In the solution, I will leave algebraic manipulation to the reader since it is boring to watch other people do algebra. While I finished the rest of the paper in 75 minutes, this problem alone took over an hour! I generally try brute forcing algebra only when I am at my wits’ end. Brute forcing the algebra worked here and it was not all that hard. The hardness is due to the fact that none of the standard inequalities like AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz worked when I tried. Adding the inequalities was weak. Adding them in batches failed too. It needed raw thinking and no theorems helped me. So its a 5 in my heart.</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> We will prove the inequality by contradiction. In fact we will contradict the constraint \[a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2+a_4^2=1.\]Without loss of generality, assume $a_4 \leq a_3 \leq a_2 \leq a_1$. Suppose for all $1\leq i &lt; j \leq 4$, \[(a_i-a_j)^2 &gt; \frac15.\] Thus we have \[ a_1-a_2 &gt; \frac1{\sqrt{5}},a_2-a_3 &gt; \frac1{\sqrt{5}}, a_3-a_4 &gt; \frac1{\sqrt{5}}. \] Now set \[a_1-a_2-\frac1{\sqrt{5}}=x,\] \[ a_2-a_3-\frac1{\sqrt{5}}=y,\] \[a_3-a_4 -\frac1{\sqrt{5}} =z,\] and note that $x,y,z &gt; 0$. Rearranging and back-substituting the variables we get \[a_3 = a_4 + \frac1{\sqrt{5}} + z,\] \[a_2 = a_4 + \frac2{\sqrt{5}} + y+z,\] \[a_1 = a_4 + \frac3{\sqrt{5}} + x+y+z.\]</p> <p>Now <em>it can be shown that</em> (meaning you should do some work!) \[a_1^2 +a_2^2+a_3^2 + a_4^2 = \left(2a_4+\dfrac{3x+2y+z+\dfrac{6}{\sqrt{5}}}{2}\right)^2 + 1 + \dfrac{3x^2}4+y^2+\frac{3z^2}4 + xy+yz+\dfrac{xz}2+\dfrac{3x+4y+3z}{\sqrt{5}}.\]The expression on the right-hand side is greater one, since $x,y,z &gt; 0$, which contradicts the given constraint.</p> <hr/> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104070926.png" alt="Problem 5"/></p> <p><em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> <b>1.5</b>.</p> <p>It’s a pleasant and straightforward problem, once you realise that you can do it by trigonometry. A single cyclic quadrilateral with angle conditions is usually a poster boy for trigonometry problems.</p> <p>The problem is pretty cute, though, and I will include it as an application of the sine rule in my geometry courses. The proof is straightforward once you have chased angles. I like cute and sweet problems in the Olympiad.</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> We proceed by trigonometry and sine rule. Let $R$ be the radius of the circle. Consider the following figure, which has angles marked. <img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104071800.png" alt="Problem 5 diagram" width="450" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"/> We have used the parallel lines to mark alternate angles equal and we have also used angles in the same segment are equal. We have to show \[OB(AB+CD) = OL(AC+BD).\] First we note that $OL = R \cos \alpha$ by applying the definition of $\cos \alpha$ in $\triangle AOL$. Using extended sine rule, we have to show \[R(2R\sin (2\alpha+\beta) + 2R\sin \beta) = R\cos \alpha (2R \sin (\alpha + \beta)+ 2R \sin (\alpha+\beta)).\] which reduces to proving</p> <p>\[\sin (2\alpha + \beta) + \sin \beta = 2 \cos \alpha \sin (\alpha+\beta).\] But this simply follows from applying $\sin x + \sin y = 2\sin \left(\dfrac{x+y}{2}\right)\cos \left(\dfrac{x-y}{2}\right).$</p> <hr/> <p><img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104073545.png" alt="Problem 5"/></p> <p><em>Comment:</em> My student Rishon Fernandes pointed to me that this problem is a subproblem of British Math Olympiad 2022 Round 1, Problem 5.</p> <p><em>RMO difficulty feeling:</em> 3.</p> <p>Nice problem. This problem is asking for the number of chains in a divisor lattice. In fact if $f(n)$ denotes the number of chains of divisors of $n$, then one can easily prove the recursion \[2f(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d).\] I thought Mobius inversion and the associated techniques will be useful. I like the question since it is steeped in Lattice theory and it is asking for a special case. So it has room for exploration and tingles the scientist in me.</p> <p>As a RMO problem, either you had to set-up a recursion, or solve it by bijecting it to some associated problem like I did in my solution below. There are many lines of attack and all of them involve some careful computation. Since it has many approaches, my difficulty feeling is lower. The difficulty rating is still 3 since writing a clear solution is tricky and the use of the bijection/recursion to get to the answer is non-trivial.</p> <p>Proof: We write the divisors of $3\cdot 2^m$ in the form of a diagram shown below (ignore the colors for now). In the diagram, if there is a path from a to b, then a divides b . <img src="/assets/img/Pasted image 20241104074433.png" alt="Hasse Diagram" width="650" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"/></p> <p>A maximal chain is a chain that cannot be enlarged by including an divisors. Every chain is contained in a maximal chain and every maximal chain has length $m+2$. In the directed graph shown, a maximal chain is a directed path starting from 1 and ending at $3\cdot2^m$. Since 1 is on the top and $3.2^m$ is on the bottom, a directed path must switch from top to bottom exactly once (since in this graph, we cant go up once we are on the bottom row). Suppose the switch happens at $3\cdot 2^k$ as shown in the figure, for $k=0,1,2,\cdots,m$.</p> <p>For $k \neq m$, any chain that is a part of this maximal chain contains 1, $3\cdot 2^k$, $3\cdot 2^m$ and we are free to choose a subset of the remaining $m-1$ elements (colored red in the figure). The number of subsets is $2^{m-1}$. Thus we have m choices for $k$ (since $k \neq m$) which gives $m$ maximal chains , and $2^{m-1}$ chains that are a subset of each of these maximal chains, we have $m\cdot 2^{m-1}$ choices.</p> <p>For $k=m$, we have to find the subsets of chains on the top row. Since there are $m$ terms from 2 to $2^m$, we have $2^m$ chains in this case.</p> <p>So totally we have $m\cdot 2^{m-1} + 2^m = (m+2)2^{m-1}$ chains.</p> <hr/> <p>I liked solving the problems and it was balanced for an RMO. I am suspecting the cut-off is upwards of 50 points since 3 problems were doable by standard problem solving techniques. I think it will be less that 70 since I think very few students will get upwards of 4 problems I will update this post once the actual cutoff is released.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Olympiad,"/><category term="solving"/><category term="rmo"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts, Outline and Comments]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Inequalities from Engel’s Olympiad book.</title><link href="https://srikanthbpai.github.io/blog/2024/Arthur-Engel's-Inequality-problems/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Inequalities from Engel’s Olympiad book."/><published>2024-11-02T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-02T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://srikanthbpai.github.io/blog/2024/Arthur-Engel&apos;s-Inequality-problems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://srikanthbpai.github.io/blog/2024/Arthur-Engel&apos;s-Inequality-problems/"><![CDATA[<p>The following tips are from Arthur Engel’s book:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Screenshot 2024-11-02 at 10.14.49 AM.png" alt="Engel's tips" width="550" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"/></p> <blockquote> <p>Prove that for any triangle with sides $a,b,c$ and area $A$, \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 4\sqrt{3}A.\)</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof:</em> We will write down the steps and explain it below: \[a^2 + b^2 +c^2 \geq ab+bc+ca = \dfrac{2A}{\sin C}+\dfrac{2A}{\sin A}+\dfrac{2A}{\sin B} \geq \dfrac{18A}{\sin A + \sin B + \sin C} \geq \dfrac{36A}{3\sqrt{3}} = 4\sqrt{3}A.\] Equality iff $a=b=c$.</p> <p>The explanations for each step</p> <ol> <li> <p>First inequality follows from applying AM-GM to the sets $\{a^2,b^2\},\{b^2,c^2\},\{c^2,a^2\}$ and adding the inequalities.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first equality follows from the area formula in terms of sines.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second inequality follows from AM-HM.</p> </li> <li> <p>The third inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality applied to sin A, sin B and sin C noting that sin is concave in $[0,\pi]$ and $A+B+C=\pi$.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Remark: There are five other proofs of this fact in Engel’s problem solving strategies.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>In triangle ABC, the angle bisectors $AD, BE, CF$ meet at $I$.

Again we see \[\dfrac{n-k}{k}\in S \implies \dfrac{k}{n}=\dfrac{1}{\frac{n-k}{k}+1} \in S.\] So we are done.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>(BMO R2 2019) Find all functions $f$ from the positive real numbers to the positive real numbers for which $f( x ) \leq f( y )$ whenever $x \leq y$ and \[f( x^4 ) +f( x^2 ) +f( x ) +f( 1 ) = x^4 + x^2 +x+1.\] for all $x&gt;0$.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof (Rishon, Lauren, Abhhi and Srikanth):</em> Clearly $f(1)=1.$ If we define $g(x) = f(x) - x$, then we see $g(x^4)+g(x^2)+g(x)=0.$ But $x=y,x=y^2$ and subtract to get \[g(y^8) = g(y)\] for all real $y &gt; 0$. Note that this means \[\displaystyle g(x^{2^n}) =g(x)=g(x^{\frac1{2^n}})\] for all $n$ and for all $x&gt;0$.</p> <p>Now we show that $g\equiv0$, by analysing two cases.</p> <p><u>Case 1:</u> For $x &lt; 1$, since $g(1)=0$, and the non-decreasing nature of $f$ we get: \[g(x) + x \leq g(1)+1 = 1\] Now we note that $x^{\frac1{2^n}}&lt;1$ since $x&lt;1$. So \[g(x) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} = g(x^{\frac1{2^n}}) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} \leq 1.\] Thus $g(x) \leq 1 - x^{\frac1{2^n}}$ for all $n$. By applying $lim_{n \to \infty}$ on both sides and noting $\lim_{n\to \infty} x^{\frac1{2^n}} = 1$ for $x&gt;0$, we get \[g(x) \leq 0.\]If $x&lt;1$, then $x^2,x^4 &lt; 1$. So $g(x^4),g(x^2),g(x)\leq 0$. But $g(x^4)+g(x^2)+g(x)=0$ and thus each term is individually zero. So we conclude $g(x) = 0$ for $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$.</p> <p><u>Case 2:</u> For $x &gt; 1$, since $g(1)=0$, \[g(x) + x \geq 1\] Now we note that $x^{\frac1{2^n}}&gt;1$ since $x&gt;1$. So \[g(x) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} = g(x^{\frac1{2^n}}) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} \geq 1.\] Thus $g(x) \geq 1 - x^{\frac1{2^n}}$ for all $n$. By applying $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty}$ on both sides and noting $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty} x^{\frac1{2^n}} = 1$ for $x&gt;0$, we get \[g(x) \geq 0.\] If $x&gt;1$, then $x^2,x^4 &gt; 1$. So $g(x^4),g(x^2),g(x)\geq 0$. But $g(x^4)+g(x^2)+g(x)=0$ and thus each is individually zero. So we conclude $g(x) = 0$ for $x &gt;1$.</p> <p>Thus we have showed that $g\equiv0$.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>(RMO 2017) Let $x, y, z$ be real numbers, each greater than 1.

Since $x \geq y \geq z$, we have \[G=\dfrac{x-y}{y^2-1}+\dfrac{y-z}{z^2-1}+\dfrac{z-y+y-x}{x^2-1}.\] This is equivalent to \[G=(y-z)\left( \dfrac{1}{z^2-1}-\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}\right)+(x-y)\left( \dfrac{1}{y^2-1}-\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}\right).\] Since $x \geq y, y \geq z$ and $x \geq z$, each expression bounded by paranthesis is non-negative.

In today’s blog post, we will discuss some strategies for the following type of problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>Find all integers $n$ such that a quadratic expression $f(n)$ (or $f(n,m,\ldots)$) is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>There are usually two strategies that are used to claim no solutions exist:</em></p> <ul> <li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue">quadratic residues</a>, argue that there are no solutions. For instance, $12m+ 19$ can never be a perfect square since it is for the form $4k+3$ and we know that 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 4.</li> <li>Bound the given expressions between two consecutive perfect squares. For instance, $n^2 +n+1$ can be bounded as follows: \[n^2 &lt; n^2+n + 1&lt; (n+1)^2.\] But there cannot be a perfect square between two consecutive perfect square numbers. So $n^2 +n+1$ cannot be a perfect square.</li> </ul> <p><em>There are usually two (related) strategies that are used to find solutions:</em></p> <ul> <li>Complete the squares and factorise using algebraic identities (usually $x^2 - y^2$). Sometimes, we can find a bound on the variables and brute force our way through. If the perfect square is factored into co-prime factors, each factor itself must be a perfect square. We will then get a system of equations to solve.</li> <li>We can use the quadratic root formula and determine when the discriminant is a perfect square.</li> </ul> <p>Following Lee’s advice, I suggest you practice many problems using the techniques discussed. Let me show you some of these kicks once. If you want to see other kicks, comment below (you need a Github account to comment). I will include them.</p> <h2 id="factoring-and-bounding-kicks">Factoring and bounding kicks</h2> <p>The following British Maths Olympiad problem can be solved in multiple ways. Enjoy the kicks.</p> <blockquote> <p>(BMO R1 2011) Find all integers $n$ for which $n^2 +20n+11$ is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof 1</em>: We claim that $n=35,-55$ are the only solutions. We proceed by completing the square. We must solve for $n$ in the following equation: \[(n+10)^2-89=k^2.\] Now $(n+10)^2 - k^2 =89$ and thus $(n+10-k)(n+10+k)=89$ . Since $89$ is prime, we get a couple of cases. <strong>Case 1:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={1,89}$. By adding and simplifying, we get $n=35$. <strong>Case 2:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={-1,-89}$. By adding and simplifying, we get $n=-55$.</p> <hr/> <p><em>Proof 2:(Abhhi and Rishon)</em> Let $N = n^2 + 20n + 11$. We will find solutions by repeatedly bounding $N$ between two consecutive squares.</p> <p>We note that for $n&gt; 35$, since $0 &lt; 2n-70$, by adding $n^2 + 18n + 81$ to both sides we see that $(n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 +20n + 11$. On the other hand, $n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; n^2 + 20 n + 100$. Thus we have for $n &gt; 35$, \[(n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+10)^2.\] Since $N$ is bounded between two consecutive squares, it cannot be a perfect square. For $n=35$, we see that $N= 44^2$. For $13 &lt; n &lt; 35$, we similarly bound $N$ again as \[(n+8)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+9)^2.\] Indeed, the lower bound reduces to $4n &gt; 53$ which holds for $n &gt; 13$ and the upper bound simplifies to $n &lt; 35$. So we have bounded $N$ between two consecutive squares again, and thus, N cannot be a perfect square. Now $n=13$ is not a solution since $N=440$ is a non-square number. Repeating the bounding trick, we can check that \[(n+7)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+8)^2\] holds for $6 &lt; n &lt; 13$ and conclude that $N$ is not a perfect square. Finally, if we plugin $n \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ we get $N \in \{32,55,80,107,136,167\}$. None of these values of $N$ are perfect squares. So we are done.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Comments:</strong> We note that Proof 1 simplified because $89$ had very few factors. On the other hand, the strategy of Proof 2 is general. Try solving the problem using the quadratic equation method.</p> <h2 id="quadratic-residue-kick">Quadratic residue kick</h2> <p>Next, I will show you another kick that uses quadratic residues. Watch closely.</p> <blockquote> <p>(Croatian MO 2009) Find all positive integers $m, n$ such that $6^m+2^n+2$ is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof:</em> We claim the only solution is $m=1,n=3.$</p> <p>Let $N = 6^m+2^n+2=2(2^{m-1}3^m+2^{n-1}+1)$ be a perfect square. Since $N$ is even, if it is a square, then 4 should divide $N$. This means $2^{m-1}3^m+2^{n-1}+1$ is even. Since the expression is odd if $m,n&gt;1$, we must have $m=1$ or $n=1$.</p> <p><em>Case 1:</em> In this case we consider $m=1$. This condition reduces to finding $n$ so that $N=2^{n} + 8$ is a perfect square. We know that the quadratic residues modulo 16 are only $0,1,4,9$. But if $n &gt; 3$, then $N \equiv 8 \mod 16$ , so it cannot be a perfect square. So n can only be 1,2 or 3. Trying each of the cases, we get N as $10,12,16$. Thus $(m,n) = (1,3)$ is the only solution in this case.</p> <p><em>Case 2:</em> In this case we consider $n=1$. This condition reduces to finding $m$ so that $N=6^{m} +4$ is a perfect square. We know that the quadratic residues modulo $7$ are only $0,1,4,9$. So \[N = 6^m + 4 \equiv (-1)^m + 4 \equiv 5,3 \mod 7.\] Since neither are quadratic residues, we are done.</p> <hr/> <p>Let me present an opportunity to practice all the kicks you have learned</p> <h2 id="practice-your-kicks">Practice your kicks</h2> <ol> <li>(Kurschak MC 1953) Let n be a positive integer, and let $d$ be a positive divisor of $2n^2$.

Thus we have three cases according to the partition of 5 as $0+5,1+4,2+3$: <strong>Case 1:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=0, (c-1)(d-1)=5.$ The first relation forces $a=1$, and $c=2,d=6$, $b=1$ or $2$. So the possible solutions in this case are $(1,1,2,6),(1,2,2,6).$ <strong>Case 2:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=1, (c-1)(d-1)=4.$ The second equation can be factored in two ways 2 x 2 and 1 x 4. The first relation forces $a=2,b=2$, and $c=2,d=5$ or $c=d=3$. So the possible solutions in this case are $(2,2,2,5),(2,2,3,3).$ <strong>Case 3:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=2, (c-1)(d-1)=3.$ <del>No solution because relation 1 fails.</del></p> <hr/> <p>(RMO 2013) Prove that there do not exist natural numbers $x$ and $y$ , with $x&gt;1$ , such that \(\dfrac{x^7 −1}{x-1} = y^5 +1.\) <em>Proof:</em> Rearranging we get \(\dfrac{x^7-x}{x-1}=y^5.\) Simplifying the expression we get \(x(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1)=y^5.\)</p> \[\begin{eqnarray} (x^2+x+1,x^3+1) &amp;= (x^2+x+1,x^3+1-x(x^2+x+1))\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,1-x^2-x)\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,2) \in \{1,2\} \end{eqnarray}\] <p>We see that if x is even, then both $x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are odd. If x is odd, then exactly one of them is even. At any rate, both are not even and thus $(x^2+x+1,x^3+1) = 1$. Clearly, $(x,x^2+x+1)=1, (x,x^3+1)=1$. Thus a product of three numbers, that are pairwise coprime, is a fifth power. <strong>Fact:</strong> If a perfect $n$th power can be factored into pairwise coprime numbers, then the factors themselves are perfect $n$th powers. From the fact and our claims above we see that $x,x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are perfect fifth powers. So $x=z^5, x^2+x+1=u^5, x^3+1=v^5$ and thus $(z^3)^5 + 1 = v^5$ . Now $x&gt; 1$, and thus we have $z^3&gt; 1,$ so no there is no solution since there are no consecutive fifth powers of natural numbers.</p> <p>For $n &gt; 1$, the the only integer solutions of $a^n = b^n +1$ is $b=0,a=1$ and when n is odd $b=-1,a=0$ .<br/> <em>Proof:</em> We prove the claim by case analysis: <strong>Case 1:</strong> First we assume a,b are non-negative integers. Note that $a&gt;b$ . Since $a-b$ divides $a^n - b^n$, we conclude $a-b=1$. Plugging in $a=b+1$, we get \(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}b^k = 0.\) Thus $b=0,a=1.$<br/> <strong>Case 2:</strong> Now if $a,b$ are non-positive, then set $a=-u, b=-v$ so that $u,v$ are non-negative. Now if n is odd we see that \(-u^n = -v^n + 1 \implies v^n = u^n+1.\) So we are in Case 1 and thus $u=0$ and $v=1$. Therefore $a=0, b=-1$.</p> <hr/> <p>(BMO R1 2015) A positive integer is called <em>charming</em> if it is equal to 2 or is of the form $3^i 5^j$ where i and j are non-negative integers. Prove that every positive integer can be written as a sum of different charming integers.</p> <p>We need the following lemma <strong>Lemma:</strong> For any positive integer $n &gt; 2$ there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq n &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\)<em>Proof:</em> We proceed by contradiction. Suppose the given statement is false, i.e. There exists positive integer n &gt; 2, for all $i,j &gt;0$ such that $2(3^i5^j) \leq n$ or $n &lt; 3^i5^j$. Choose $i_0,j_0$ such that $3^{i_0}5^{j_0} &lt; n$ and is the largest such. For our $i_0,j_0$, we have $2(3^{i_0}5^{j_0}) \leq n.$</p> <p>This means there is an positive integer $n&gt;2$ such that $2 (3^{i_0} 5^{j_0}) \leq n &lt; 3^{i_0+1}5^{j_0},$ for any $i,j$. If $j&gt;0$, then we claim \(3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; n &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1})\) $3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; 2(3^i5^j)\leq n &lt; 3^{i+1}5^j &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1}).$ So $i &gt; 0$, <del>a similar proof can be given.</del> $\blacksquare$</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> We proceed by strong induction. Let P(n) denote the proposition: “The number n can be written as a sum of different charming integers.” <strong>Base case:</strong> P(1) is true since $1= 3^0$. <strong>Strong induction hypothesis:</strong> $P(n)$ is true for all $n &lt; k$. <strong>Strong induction claim:</strong> $P(k)$ is true. <em>Proof:</em> First we note that $P(2)$ is true since 2 is given to be charming. For k&gt; 2, the lemma states that there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq k &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\) Let $m = k - 3^i5^j$ and thus $0 \leq m &lt; 3^i5^j$. Since $m &lt; 3^i 5^j \leq k$, we have $m &lt; k.$ If $m=0$, then $k=3^i5^j$ and thus k is charming. So $P(k)$ is true. On the other hand if $k &gt; m &gt; 0$, from strong induction claim, we have m is a sum of different charming numbers. Since $m &lt; 3^i5^j$, the number $3^i5^j$ cannot appear in any decomposition of m into different charming numbers. Therefore if we replace $m$ by sum of any set of charming numbers \(k = m + 3^i5^j\) then k is a sum of different charming numbers.</p> <p>240 = c + (240-c).

But 6x6 square has area 36. So this is the required contradiction.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p><strong>The numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , n are arranged in a particular order.

Now the family of polynomials $x^2 + (n+1)x + n$ is represented by the set of lattice points on the line y=x-1. Since the starting and ending points lie on the either side, the path must cross the polynomial $x^2 + (n+1)x + n$ which has integer roots.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>(BMO R2 2016) <strong>Naomi and Tom play a game, with Naomi going first. They take it in turns to pick an integer from 1 to 100, each time selecting an integer which no-one has chosen before. A player loses the game if, after their turn, the sum of all the integers chosen since the start of the game (by both of them) cannot be written as the difference of two square numbers. Determine if one of the players has a winning strategy, and if so, which.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof:</em> I claim Naomi has a winning strategy. First we note that n cannot be written as difference of two squares iff $n \equiv 2 \mod 4$ . 25 numbers are 0,1,2,3 mod 4 from 1 to 100. Naomi’s strategy is to maintain the sum of the picked numbers as a multiple of 4 forcing Tom to eventually pick a number congruent to 2 mod 4. She can implement the strategy by the following procedure:</p> <ul> <li>Start with a 4</li> <li>If tom picks 1 mod 4, then choose a number that is 3 mod 4 number and vice versa.</li> <li>If tom picks a multiple of 4, then write a multiple of 4. Naomi can always run her strategy because of the following reasons:</li> <li>Since there are odd number of multiples of 4, she will always be the last one to write a multiple of 4.</li> <li>Since there are equal numbers of 1 and 3 mod 4 numbers and she never starts with one of them, she will be the last one to write 1 or 3. Since she never has to write a 2 mod 4, she wins.</li> </ul> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Olympiad,"/><category term="solving"/><category term="invariant"/><category term="monovariant"/><category term="combinatorics"/><category term="Olympiad"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 6 x 6 square is dissected into nine rectangles by lines parallel to its side such that all these rectangles have integer sides.

He takes cards from the deck one at a time and places the selected cards in a row, with each new card added at the right end. Matthew must arrange for the mean of the numbers on the cards in the row to be an integer. If, at some point, there is no card remaining in the deck, which allows Matthew to continue, then he stops. When Matthew stopped, what was the smallest possible number of cards that he could have placed in the row? Give an example of such a row.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof(Abhhi, Rishon and Srikanth):</em> We claim the smallest possible number of cards is 17. First we show that Matthew must have placed at least 17 cards on the table. Suppose Matt has $k$ cards on the table and let us denote it by $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k$. If Matt can place a new card $x_{k+1}$ on the table, then we need (k+1) to divide $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} x_i$ and thus \[x_{k+1}\equiv -(x_1+x_2+\ldots x_{k}) \mod (k+1).\] Let $a$ denote the congruence class of $-(x_1+x_2+\ldots x_{k})$ modulo $(k+1)$. The only way he cannot place card $x_{k+1}$ is if all the cards with $-a \mod (k+1)$ has already been placed on the table. Since each congruence class appears at most $\left\lfloor \dfrac{300}{k+1} \right\rfloor$ times and we have placed only $k$ cards, we must have \[ \left\lfloor \dfrac{300}{k+1} \right\rfloor &lt; k+1 \] This inequality is satisfied iff $k \geq 17$.</p> <p>Now we show k=17 can be achieved. Matt writes all the numbers of the form 1 mod 18 in increasing order. So he writes 17 numbers this way. Now the sum of the cards on the table is \[\sum_{k=0}^{16} (18k+1) = 18 \times \frac{(16 \times 17)}{2}+17 \equiv 0+(-1) \mod 18.\] Now Matt has exhausted all the numbers of the form 1 mod 18 and thus cant continue. So 17 cards is achievable.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Olympiad,"/><category term="solving"/><category term="combinatorics"/><category term="Olympiad"/><category term="construction"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(BMO R1 2017) Matthew has a deck of 300 cards numbered 1 to 300.
