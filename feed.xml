We are supposed to minimize $r^2$ and the constraint reduces to \[r^2 \sin 4\theta = 4.\] So $r^2$ is minimized when $\sin 4\theta = 1.$ Thus the minimum value of $r^2$ is $4$.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>[BMO 2008] Find all real values of $x, y$ and $z$ such that<br/> \[(x+1)yz = 12\] \[(y+1)zx=4\] \[(z+1)xy = 4\]</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Solution(Mrinal).</em> We begin by subtracting (2) from (3), which yields \[x(y-z)=0.\] Clearly $x \neq 0$ as it would not satisfy the last two equations, and thus $y=z$. We proceed by subtracting (2) from (1), and adding (2) and (3), yielding \[y(y-x)=2xy(y+1)=8.\] Thus $x = \frac{4}{y(y+1)}$. Substituting this into the above, we get</p> \[\\ \begin{aligned} y\left(y-\dfrac{4}{y(y+1)}\right)&amp;=8. \\ y^3+y^2-8y-12&amp;=0, \\ (y+2)^2(y-3)&amp;=0. \end{aligned} \\\] <p>Thus, the required solution sets are $(x, y, z) = (2, -2, -2) \ \text{and} \ \left(\frac{1}{3}, 3, 3\right).$</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>(BMO 1993) Let x,y,z be positive real numbers satisfying $\frac{1}{3} \leq xy+yz+zx \leq 3$ .

We choose $x=\alpha,y=z=\frac1{\alpha}$ then we see that $xy+yx+xz = 2+\frac1{\alpha^2}$ which satisfies the given inequality for $\alpha \geq 1$. Now \[xyz = \frac1{\alpha}.\] Note that for any real $r \in (0,1]$, $\alpha = \frac1{r}$ will give $xyz=r$.

Since $x,y,z &gt; 0$ we conclude $x+y+z \geq 1.$ Equality can be achieved for $x=y=z=\frac13,$ which is also satisfied by the given inequality (in the problem statement).</p> <p>We will show that all the values above 1 will be achieved using <em>intermediate value theorem</em> (which can be found at the end of this solution).</p> <p>If we choose $x=\frac13 + r,y=\frac13,z=\frac13$, then we see that \[xy+yx+xz = \frac{2r+1}3 .\] The given inequality reduces to $0\leq r \leq 4.$ Thus we see that the range of $x+y+z = 1+r$ is $[1,5]$ for $0\leq r \leq 4.$</p> <p>Let $\alpha &gt; 0$ be a real. Next we take $x=\alpha,y=z=\frac1{\alpha}$ then we see that $xy+yx+xz = 2+\frac1{\alpha^2}$ which satisfies the given inequality for $\alpha \geq 1$. Now \[x+y+z = \alpha + \frac{2}{\alpha} \geq 2\sqrt{2}.\] The last inequality is by AM-GM and equality is achieved at $\alpha = \sqrt{2}$. Now since $f(\alpha) = \alpha + \frac{2}{\alpha}$ is a continuous unbounded function, by IMVT its range is $[2\sqrt{2},\infty)$ .</p> <p>Thus we conclude $[1,5] \cup [2\sqrt{2},\infty)=[1,\infty)$ is the range of $x+y+z$.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="appendix-to-problem-1">Appendix to Problem 1:</h3> <p><u>(Intermediate Value Theorem/IMVT)</u> Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function.

Note that this means \[\displaystyle g(x^{2^n}) =g(x)=g(x^{\frac1{2^n}})\] for all $n$ and for all $x&gt;0$.</p> <p>Now we show that $g\equiv0$, by analysing two cases.</p> <p><u>Case 1:</u> For $x &lt; 1$, since $g(1)=0$, and the non-decreasing nature of $f$ we get: \[g(x) + x \leq g(1)+1 = 1\] Now we note that $x^{\frac1{2^n}}&lt;1$ since $x&lt;1$. So \[g(x) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} = g(x^{\frac1{2^n}}) + x^{\frac1{2^n}} \leq 1.\] Thus $g(x) \leq 1 - x^{\frac1{2^n}}$ for all $n$. By applying $lim_{n \to \infty}$ on both sides and noting $\lim_{n\to \infty} x^{\frac1{2^n}} = 1$ for $x&gt;0$, we get \[g(x) \leq 0.\]If $x&lt;1$, then $x^2,x^4 &lt; 1$. So $g(x^4),g(x^2),g(x)\leq 0$. But $g(x^4)+g(x^2)+g(x)=0$ and thus each term is individually zero.

Since $x \geq y \geq z$, we have \[G=\dfrac{x-y}{y^2-1}+\dfrac{y-z}{z^2-1}+\dfrac{z-y+y-x}{x^2-1}.\] This is equivalent to \[G=(y-z)\left( \dfrac{1}{z^2-1}-\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}\right)+(x-y)\left( \dfrac{1}{y^2-1}-\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}\right).\] Since $x \geq y, y \geq z$ and $x \geq z$, each expression bounded by paranthesis is non-negative.

In today’s blog post, we will discuss some strategies for the following type of problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>Find all integers $n$ such that a quadratic expression $f(n)$ (or $f(n,m,\ldots)$) is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>There are usually two strategies that are used to claim no solutions exist:</em></p> <ul> <li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue">quadratic residues</a>, argue that there are no solutions. For instance, $12m+ 19$ can never be a perfect square since it is for the form $4k+3$ and we know that 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 4.</li> <li>Bound the given expressions between two consecutive perfect squares. For instance, $n^2 +n+1$ can be bounded as follows: \[n^2 &lt; n^2+n + 1&lt; (n+1)^2.\] But there cannot be a perfect square between two consecutive perfect square numbers. So $n^2 +n+1$ cannot be a perfect square.</li> </ul> <p><em>There are usually two (related) strategies that are used to find solutions:</em></p> <ul> <li>Complete the squares and factorise using algebraic identities (usually $x^2 - y^2$). Sometimes, we can find a bound on the variables and brute force our way through. If the perfect square is factored into co-prime factors, each factor itself must be a perfect square. We will then get a system of equations to solve.</li> <li>We can use the quadratic root formula and determine when the discriminant is a perfect square.</li> </ul> <p>Following Lee’s advice, I suggest you practice many problems using the techniques discussed. Let me show you some of these kicks once. If you want to see other kicks, comment below (you need a Github account to comment). I will include them.</p> <h2 id="factoring-and-bounding-kicks">Factoring and bounding kicks</h2> <p>The following British Maths Olympiad problem can be solved in multiple ways. Enjoy the kicks.</p> <blockquote> <p>(BMO R1 2011) Find all integers $n$ for which $n^2 +20n+11$ is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof 1</em>: We claim that $n=35,-55$ are the only solutions. We proceed by completing the square. We must solve for $n$ in the following equation: \[(n+10)^2-89=k^2.\] Now $(n+10)^2 - k^2 =89$ and thus $(n+10-k)(n+10+k)=89$ . Since $89$ is prime, we get a couple of cases. <strong>Case 1:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={1,89}$. By adding and simplifying, we get $n=35$. <strong>Case 2:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={-1,-89}$. By adding and simplifying, we get $n=-55$.</p> <hr/> <p><em>Proof 2:(Abhhi and Rishon)</em> Let $N = n^2 + 20n + 11$. We will find solutions by repeatedly bounding $N$ between two consecutive squares.</p> <p>We note that for $n&gt; 35$, since $0 &lt; 2n-70$, by adding $n^2 + 18n + 81$ to both sides we see that $(n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 +20n + 11$. On the other hand, $n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; n^2 + 20 n + 100$. Thus we have for $n &gt; 35$, \[(n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+10)^2.\] Since $N$ is bounded between two consecutive squares, it cannot be a perfect square. For $n=35$, we see that $N= 44^2$. For $13 &lt; n &lt; 35$, we similarly bound $N$ again as \[(n+8)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+9)^2.\] Indeed, the lower bound reduces to $4n &gt; 53$ which holds for $n &gt; 13$ and the upper bound simplifies to $n &lt; 35$. So we have bounded $N$ between two consecutive squares again, and thus, N cannot be a perfect square. Now $n=13$ is not a solution since $N=440$ is a non-square number. Repeating the bounding trick, we can check that \[(n+7)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+8)^2\] holds for $6 &lt; n &lt; 13$ and conclude that $N$ is not a perfect square. Finally, if we plugin $n \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ we get $N \in \{32,55,80,107,136,167\}$. None of these values of $N$ are perfect squares. So we are done.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Comments:</strong> We note that Proof 1 simplified because $89$ had very few factors. On the other hand, the strategy of Proof 2 is general. Try solving the problem using the quadratic equation method.</p> <h2 id="quadratic-residue-kick">Quadratic residue kick</h2> <p>Next, I will show you another kick that uses quadratic residues. Watch closely.</p> <blockquote> <p>(Croatian MO 2009) Find all positive integers $m, n$ such that $6^m+2^n+2$ is a perfect square.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Proof:</em> We claim the only solution is $m=1,n=3.$</p> <p>Let $N = 6^m+2^n+2=2(2^{m-1}3^m+2^{n-1}+1)$ be a perfect square. Since $N$ is even, if it is a square, then 4 should divide $N$. This means $2^{m-1}3^m+2^{n-1}+1$ is even. Since the expression is odd if $m,n&gt;1$, we must have $m=1$ or $n=1$.</p> <p><em>Case 1:</em> In this case we consider $m=1$. This condition reduces to finding $n$ so that $N=2^{n} + 8$ is a perfect square. We know that the quadratic residues modulo 16 are only $0,1,4,9$. But if $n &gt; 3$, then $N \equiv 8 \mod 16$ , so it cannot be a perfect square. So n can only be 1,2 or 3. Trying each of the cases, we get N as $10,12,16$. Thus $(m,n) = (1,3)$ is the only solution in this case.</p> <p><em>Case 2:</em> In this case we consider $n=1$. This condition reduces to finding $m$ so that $N=6^{m} +4$ is a perfect square. We know that the quadratic residues modulo $7$ are only $0,1,4,9$. So \[N = 6^m + 4 \equiv (-1)^m + 4 \equiv 5,3 \mod 7.\] Since neither are quadratic residues, we are done.</p> <hr/> <p>Let me present an opportunity to practice all the kicks you have learned</p> <h2 id="practice-your-kicks">Practice your kicks</h2> <ol> <li>(Kurschak MC 1953) Let n be a positive integer, and let $d$ be a positive divisor of $2n^2$.

Thus we have three cases according to the partition of 5 as $0+5,1+4,2+3$: <strong>Case 1:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=0, (c-1)(d-1)=5.$ The first relation forces $a=1$, and $c=2,d=6$, $b=1$ or $2$. So the possible solutions in this case are $(1,1,2,6),(1,2,2,6).$ <strong>Case 2:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=1, (c-1)(d-1)=4.$ The second equation can be factored in two ways 2 x 2 and 1 x 4.

So the possible solutions in this case are $(2,2,2,5),(2,2,3,3).$ <strong>Case 3:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=2, (c-1)(d-1)=3.$ <del>No solution because relation 1 fails.</del></p> <hr/> <p>(RMO 2013) Prove that there do not exist natural numbers $x$ and $y$ , with $x&gt;1$ , such that \(\dfrac{x^7 −1}{x-1} = y^5 +1.\) <em>Proof:</em> Rearranging we get \(\dfrac{x^7-x}{x-1}=y^5.\) Simplifying the expression we get \(x(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1)=y^5.\)</p> \[\begin{eqnarray} (x^2+x+1,x^3+1) &amp;= (x^2+x+1,x^3+1-x(x^2+x+1))\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,1-x^2-x)\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,2) \in \{1,2\} \end{eqnarray}\] <p>We see that if x is even, then both $x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are odd. If x is odd, then exactly one of them is even. At any rate, both are not even and thus $(x^2+x+1,x^3+1) = 1$. Clearly, $(x,x^2+x+1)=1, (x,x^3+1)=1$. Thus a product of three numbers, that are pairwise coprime, is a fifth power. <strong>Fact:</strong> If a perfect $n$th power can be factored into pairwise coprime numbers, then the factors themselves are perfect $n$th powers. From the fact and our claims above we see that $x,x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are perfect fifth powers. So $x=z^5, x^2+x+1=u^5, x^3+1=v^5$ and thus $(z^3)^5 + 1 = v^5$ . Now $x&gt; 1$, and thus we have $z^3&gt; 1,$ so no there is no solution since there are no consecutive fifth powers of natural numbers.</p> <p>For $n &gt; 1$, the the only integer solutions of $a^n = b^n +1$ is $b=0,a=1$ and when n is odd $b=-1,a=0$ .<br/> <em>Proof:</em> We prove the claim by case analysis: <strong>Case 1:</strong> First we assume a,b are non-negative integers. Note that $a&gt;b$ . Since $a-b$ divides $a^n - b^n$, we conclude $a-b=1$. Plugging in $a=b+1$, we get \(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}b^k = 0.\) Thus $b=0,a=1.$<br/> <strong>Case 2:</strong> Now if $a,b$ are non-positive, then set $a=-u, b=-v$ so that $u,v$ are non-negative. Now if n is odd we see that \(-u^n = -v^n + 1 \implies v^n = u^n+1.\) So we are in Case 1 and thus $u=0$ and $v=1$. Therefore $a=0, b=-1$.</p> <hr/> <p>(BMO R1 2015) A positive integer is called <em>charming</em> if it is equal to 2 or is of the form $3^i 5^j$ where i and j are non-negative integers. Prove that every positive integer can be written as a sum of different charming integers.</p> <p>We need the following lemma <strong>Lemma:</strong> For any positive integer $n &gt; 2$ there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq n &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\)<em>Proof:</em> We proceed by contradiction. Suppose the given statement is false, i.e. There exists positive integer n &gt; 2, for all $i,j &gt;0$ such that $2(3^i5^j) \leq n$ or $n &lt; 3^i5^j$. Choose $i_0,j_0$ such that $3^{i_0}5^{j_0} &lt; n$ and is the largest such. For our $i_0,j_0$, we have $2(3^{i_0}5^{j_0}) \leq n.$</p> <p>This means there is an positive integer $n&gt;2$ such that $2 (3^{i_0} 5^{j_0}) \leq n &lt; 3^{i_0+1}5^{j_0},$ for any $i,j$. If $j&gt;0$, then we claim \(3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; n &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1})\) $3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; 2(3^i5^j)\leq n &lt; 3^{i+1}5^j &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1}).$ So $i &gt; 0$, <del>a similar proof can be given.</del> $\blacksquare$</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> We proceed by strong induction. Let P(n) denote the proposition: “The number n can be written as a sum of different charming integers.” <strong>Base case:</strong> P(1) is true since $1= 3^0$. <strong>Strong induction hypothesis:</strong> $P(n)$ is true for all $n &lt; k$. <strong>Strong induction claim:</strong> $P(k)$ is true. <em>Proof:</em> First we note that $P(2)$ is true since 2 is given to be charming. For k&gt; 2, the lemma states that there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq k &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\) Let $m = k - 3^i5^j$ and thus $0 \leq m &lt; 3^i5^j$. Since $m &lt; 3^i 5^j \leq k$, we have $m &lt; k.$ If $m=0$, then $k=3^i5^j$ and thus k is charming. So $P(k)$ is true. On the other hand if $k &gt; m &gt; 0$, from strong induction claim, we have m is a sum of different charming numbers. Since $m &lt; 3^i5^j$, the number $3^i5^j$ cannot appear in any decomposition of m into different charming numbers. Therefore if we replace $m$ by sum of any set of charming numbers \(k = m + 3^i5^j\) then k is a sum of different charming numbers.</p> <p>240 = c + (240-c).

First we show that Matthew must have placed at least 17 cards on the table. Suppose Matt has $k$ cards on the table and let us denote it by $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k$. If Matt can place a new card $x_{k+1}$ on the table, then we need (k+1) to divide $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} x_i$ and thus \[x_{k+1}\equiv -(x_1+x_2+\ldots x_{k}) \mod (k+1).\] Let $a$ denote the congruence class of $-(x_1+x_2+\ldots x_{k})$ modulo $(k+1)$. The only way he cannot place card $x_{k+1}$ is if all the cards with $-a \mod (k+1)$ has already been placed on the table. Since each congruence class appears at most $\left\lfloor \dfrac{300}{k+1} \right\rfloor$ times and we have placed only $k$ cards, we must have \[ \left\lfloor \dfrac{300}{k+1} \right\rfloor &lt; k+1 \] This inequality is satisfied iff $k \geq 17$.</p> <p>Now we show k=17 can be achieved. Matt writes all the numbers of the form 1 mod 18 in increasing order. So he writes 17 numbers this way. Now the sum of the cards on the table is \[\sum_{k=0}^{16} (18k+1) = 18 \times \frac{(16 \times 17)}{2}+17 \equiv 0+(-1) \mod 18.\] Now Matt has exhausted all the numbers of the form 1 mod 18 and thus cant continue. So 17 cards is achievable.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cool"/><category term="math,"/><category term="Olympiad"/><category term="combinatorics"/><category term="Olympiad"/><category term="construction"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(BMO R1 2017) Matthew has a deck of 300 cards numbered 1 to 300.
