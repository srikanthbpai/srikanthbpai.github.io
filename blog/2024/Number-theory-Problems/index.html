We proceed by completing the square. We have to solve for n in the following equation: \((n+10)^2-89=k^2\) Now $(n+10)^2 - k^2 =89$ and thus $(n+10-k)(n+10+k)=89$ . Since 89 is prime, we get a couple of cases. <strong>Case 1:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={1,89}$. Adding and simplifying, we get $n=35$. <strong>Case 2:</strong> ${n+10-k,n+10+k}={-1,-89}$. Adding and simplifying, we get $n=-55$.</p> <p><em>Aliter</em>: Let $N = n^2 + 20n + 11$. We note that for $n&gt; 35$, since $0 &lt; 2n-70$, by adding $n^2 + 18n + 81$ to both sides we see that $(n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 +20n + 11$. On the other hand, $n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; n^2 + 20 n + 100$. Thus we have for $n &gt; 35$, \((n+9)^2 &lt; n^2 + 20n + 11 &lt; (n+10)^2.\) Since $N$ is bounded between two consecutive squares, it cannot be a perfect square. Since 11 is not a quadratic residue of 3 or 4, $N = k^2$ has no solutions if 3 or 4 divide $n$. Thus we have to check only 1,2,5,7,10,11,13,14,17,19,22,23,25,26,29,31,34,35. (Don’t do this in RMO) <del>It turns out 35 is the only solutions in this case.</del></p> <hr> <p>(RMO 2002) Find all integers a, b, c, d satisfying the following relations: 1. $1\leq a\leq b\leq c\leq d$ 2. $ab+cd=a+b+c+d+3.$ <em>Proof</em>: Writing the second equation as \((a-1)(b-1)+(c-1)(d-1)=5.\) From the first relation, we see that $0 \leq (a-1)(b-1) \leq (c-1)(d-1)$. Thus we have three cases according to the partition of 5 as $0+5,1+4,2+3$: <strong>Case 1:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=0, (c-1)(d-1)=5.$ The first relation forces $a=1$, and $c=2,d=6$, $b=1$ or $2$. So the possible solutions in this case are $(1,1,2,6),(1,2,2,6).$ <strong>Case 2:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=1, (c-1)(d-1)=4.$ The second equation can be factored in two ways 2 x 2 and 1 x 4. The first relation forces $a=2,b=2$, and $c=2,d=5$ or $c=d=3$. So the possible solutions in this case are $(2,2,2,5),(2,2,3,3).$ <strong>Case 3:</strong> $(a-1)(b-1)=2, (c-1)(d-1)=3.$ <del>No solution because relation 1 fails.</del></p> <hr> <p>(RMO 2013) Prove that there do not exist natural numbers $x$ and $y$ , with $x&gt;1$ , such that \(\dfrac{x^7 −1}{x-1} = y^5 +1.\) <em>Proof:</em> Rearranging we get \(\dfrac{x^7-x}{x-1}=y^5.\) Simplifying the expression we get \(x(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1)=y^5.\) \(\begin{eqnarray} (x^2+x+1,x^3+1) &amp;= (x^2+x+1,x^3+1-x(x^2+x+1))\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,1-x^2-x)\\ &amp;= (x^2+x+1,2) \in \{1,2\} \end{eqnarray}\) We see that if x is even, then both $x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are odd. If x is odd, then exactly one of them is even. At any rate, both are not even and thus $(x^2+x+1,x^3+1) = 1$. Clearly, $(x,x^2+x+1)=1, (x,x^3+1)=1$. Thus a product of three numbers, that are pairwise coprime, is a fifth power. <strong>Fact:</strong> If a perfect $n$th power can be factored into pairwise coprime numbers, then the factors themselves are perfect $n$th powers. From the fact and our claims above we see that $x,x^2+x+1,x^3+1$ are perfect fifth powers. So $x=z^5, x^2+x+1=u^5, x^3+1=v^5$ and thus $(z^3)^5 + 1 = v^5$ . Now $x&gt; 1$, and thus we have $z^3&gt; 1,$ so no there is no solution since there are no consecutive fifth powers of natural numbers.</p> <p>For $n &gt; 1$, the the only integer solutions of $a^n = b^n +1$ is $b=0,a=1$ and when n is odd $b=-1,a=0$ .<br> <em>Proof:</em> We prove the claim by case analysis: <strong>Case 1:</strong> First we assume a,b are non-negative integers. Note that $a&gt;b$ . Since $a-b$ divides $a^n - b^n$, we conclude $a-b=1$. Plugging in $a=b+1$, we get \(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}b^k = 0.\) Thus $b=0,a=1.$<br> <strong>Case 2:</strong> Now if $a,b$ are non-positive, then set $a=-u, b=-v$ so that $u,v$ are non-negative. Now if n is odd we see that \(-u^n = -v^n + 1 \implies v^n = u^n+1.\) So we are in Case 1 and thus $u=0$ and $v=1$. Therefore $a=0, b=-1$.</p> <hr> <p>(BMO R1 2015) A positive integer is called <em>charming</em> if it is equal to 2 or is of the form $3^i 5^j$ where i and j are non-negative integers. Prove that every positive integer can be written as a sum of different charming integers.</p> <p>We need the following lemma <strong>Lemma:</strong> For any positive integer $n &gt; 2$ there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq n &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\)<em>Proof:</em> We proceed by contradiction. Suppose the given statement is false, i.e. There exists positive integer n &gt; 2, for all $i,j &gt;0$ such that $2(3^i5^j) \leq n$ or $n &lt; 3^i5^j$. Choose $i_0,j_0$ such that $3^{i_0}5^{j_0} &lt; n$ and is the largest such. For our $i_0,j_0$, we have $2(3^{i_0}5^{j_0}) \leq n.$</p> <p>This means there is an positive integer $n&gt;2$ such that $2 (3^{i_0} 5^{j_0}) \leq n &lt; 3^{i_0+1}5^{j_0},$ for any $i,j$. If $j&gt;0$, then we claim \(3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; n &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1})\) $3^{i+2}5^{j-1} &lt; 2(3^i5^j)\leq n &lt; 3^{i+1}5^j &lt; 2(3^{i+2}5^{j-1}).$ So $i &gt; 0$, <del>a similar proof can be given.</del> $\blacksquare$</p> <p><em>Proof:</em> We proceed by strong induction. Let P(n) denote the proposition: “The number n can be written as a sum of different charming integers.” <strong>Base case:</strong> P(1) is true since $1= 3^0$. <strong>Strong induction hypothesis:</strong> $P(n)$ is true for all $n &lt; k$. <strong>Strong induction claim:</strong> $P(k)$ is true. <em>Proof:</em> First we note that $P(2)$ is true since 2 is given to be charming. For k&gt; 2, the lemma states that there exists $i,j &gt; 0$ such that \(3^i 5^j \leq k &lt; 2 (3^i 5^j).\) Let $m = k - 3^i5^j$ and thus $0 \leq m &lt; 3^i5^j$. Since $m &lt; 3^i 5^j \leq k$, we have $m &lt; k.$ If $m=0$, then $k=3^i5^j$ and thus k is charming. So $P(k)$ is true. On the other hand if $k &gt; m &gt; 0$, from strong induction claim, we have m is a sum of different charming numbers. Since $m &lt; 3^i5^j$, the number $3^i5^j$ cannot appear in any decomposition of m into different charming numbers. Therefore if we replace $m$ by sum of any set of charming numbers \(k = m + 3^i5^j\) then k is a sum of different charming numbers.</p> <p>240 = c + (240-c). If we choose largest possible c, then perhaps c &gt; 240 -c =&gt; 2c &gt; 240 &gt; c &lt;=&gt; c&lt; 240 &lt; 2c</p> </body></html>
