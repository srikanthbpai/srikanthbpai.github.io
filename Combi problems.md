> A positive integer 𝑛 is called _good_ if there is a set of divisors of 𝑛 whose members sum to 𝑛 and include 1. Prove that every positive integer has a multiple, which is good.

_Proof:_ We claim that $n!$ is good for $n > 2$.We proceed by induction. Base case: We note that $3! = 1+2 +3$ is good. Suppose n! can be written as $$n! = 1 + d_2+d_3+
\ldots + d_k$$ where $d_i$ divides $n!$. We see that if we multiply $n+1$ to the above equation, we get $$(n+1)! = n+1 +(n+1)d_2+\ldots+(n+1)d_k.$$Now note that since $d_j > 1$ for all j. So we are sure $n$ will not repeat. Also note that the summands are divisors of $(n+1)!$.

> (Old RMO) Let n be a natural number. Show that $$\left[\dfrac{n}{1}\right]+\left[\dfrac{n}{2}\right]+ \left[\dfrac{n}{3}\right]+\ldots \left[\dfrac{n}{n}\right] + \left[\sqrt{n}\right]$$ is even.

_Proof:_ Let $U = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid xy < n, \text{ and } x,y > 0\}$ . Consider the integer points on the line $y=x$ that

> There are 2019 penguins waddling towards their favourite restaurant. As the penguins arrive, they are handed tickets numbered in ascending order from 1 to 2019, and told to join the queue. The first penguin starts the queue.
> For each n > 1 the penguin holding ticket number n finds the greatest m < n which divides n and enters the queue directly behind the penguin holding ticket number m. This continues until all 2019 penguins are in the queue.
> (a) How many penguins are in front of the penguin with ticket number 2?
> (b) What numbers are on the tickets held by the penguins just in front of and just behind the penguin holding ticket 33?

_Proof:_ Powers of 2 stand behind 2 and thus there are 2009 penguins ahead of 2.

> For each integer 0 ≤ n ≤ 11, Eliza has exactly three identical pieces of gold that weigh $2^n$ grams. In how many different ways can she form a pile of gold weighing 2021 grams?
> (Two piles are different if they contain different numbers of gold pieces of some weight. The arrangement of the pieces in the piles is irrelevant.)

_Proof:_

> Let ABC be a triangle. Let L be the line through B perpendicular to AB. The perpendicular from A to BC meets L at the point D. The perpendicular bisector of BC meets L at the point P. Let E be the foot of the perpendicular from D to AC. Prove that triangle BPE is isosceles.

> Marvin has been tasked with writing down every list of integers with the following properties:
> (i) The list contains 71 terms.
> (ii) The first term is 1.
> (iii) Every term after the first is equal to either the previous term, or the sum of all previous terms.
> When Marvin is finished, how many of the lists will have a sum equal to 999,999?

_Proof:_

> Six children are evenly spaced around a circular table. Initially, one has a pile of n > 0 sweets in front of them, and the others have nothing. If a child has at least four sweets in front of them, they may perform the following move: eat one sweet and give one sweet to each of their immediate neighbours and to the child directly opposite them. An arrangement is called perfect if there is a sequence of moves which results in each child having the same number of sweets in front of them. For which values of n is the initial arrangement perfect?

_Proof:_

> Eliza has a large collection of 𝑎 × 𝑎 and 𝑏 × 𝑏 tiles where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are positive integers. She arranges some of these tiles, without overlaps, to form a square of side length 𝑛. Prove that she can cover another square of side length 𝑛 using only one of her two types of tile.

_Proof:_

> Let 𝐴𝐵𝐶 be a triangle with 𝐴𝐵 > 𝐴𝐶. Its circumcircle is Γ and its incentre is 𝐼. Let 𝐷 be the contact point of the incircle of 𝐴𝐵𝐶 with 𝐵𝐶.
> Let 𝐾 be the point on Γ such that ∠𝐴𝐾𝐼 is a right angle. Prove that 𝐴𝐼 and 𝐾𝐷 meet on Γ.

_Proof:_
